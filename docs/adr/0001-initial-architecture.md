# ADR 0001: Initial Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Feature Table of Contents (ftoc) utility needs an architecture that supports parsing and analyzing Cucumber feature files to produce useful outputs like table of contents, tag analysis, and quality recommendations. The architecture should be extensible for future features and support various Cucumber implementations.

## Decision

We will implement ftoc with the following architecture:

1. **Core Components:**
   - `FtocUtility`: Main class that orchestrates the analysis process
   - `FeatureParser`: Responsible for parsing feature files
   - `TagAnalyzer`: Analyzes tags in feature files
   - `OutputFormatter`: Formats output in different formats (text, markdown, HTML, JSON)

2. **Design Patterns:**
   - **Strategy Pattern**: For different output formats
   - **Visitor Pattern**: For walking through parsed feature structures
   - **Factory Pattern**: For creating appropriate parsers based on file types

3. **Project Structure:**
   - `src/main/java/com/heymumford/ftoc/` - Core code
   - `src/test/` - Tests
   - `src/test/resources/ftoc/test-feature-files/` - Test feature files

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns between parsing, analysis, and output
- Extensible architecture for adding new features and output formats
- Testable components with clear boundaries

### Negative
- More complex than a simple procedural approach
- Requires more initial setup and boilerplate code

### Risks
- Over-engineering for a simple utility
- Potential performance implications for very large feature sets

### Mitigations
- Start with a minimal viable implementation
- Use profiling to identify performance bottlenecks
- Keep interfaces simple and cohesive

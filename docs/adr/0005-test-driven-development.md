# ADR 0005: Test-Driven Development Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ftoc utility is designed to analyze Cucumber feature files, which makes it an excellent candidate for test-driven development using Cucumber itself (dogfooding). We need a testing strategy that:

1. Validates the functionality of ftoc
2. Serves as examples of what ftoc can analyze
3. Guides the implementation of features
4. Ensures regression-free development

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive test-driven development approach:

1. **Self-testing with Cucumber**:
   - Use Cucumber to test ftoc itself
   - Define expected behavior in feature files
   - Implement step definitions that validate results

2. **Test Feature Set**:
   - Create a diverse set of test feature files with different patterns
   - Include edge cases and various Cucumber syntax elements
   - Cover all scenarios that ftoc should handle

3. **Test First Development**:
   - Write tests before implementing features
   - Start with "placeholder" implementations that pass minimal tests
   - Gradually enhance functionality to pass more complex tests

4. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Run all tests on every build
   - Ensure no regression of existing functionality

## Consequences

### Positive

- Tests serve as executable specifications
- Ensures ftoc handles a variety of feature file patterns
- Provides confidence in refactoring
- Creates a regression test suite automatically
- Demonstrates ftoc's capabilities through real examples

### Negative

- Requires more upfront effort
- Tests may become complex
- Need to maintain test feature files

### Risks

- Tests might focus too much on implementation details
- Test feature files might not cover all real-world scenarios

### Mitigations

- Focus tests on behavior, not implementation
- Continuously expand test feature files based on user feedback
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

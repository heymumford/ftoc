# ADR-0007: GitHub Copilot Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the FTOC codebase grows, we need to ensure developer productivity and consistent code quality. GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI-assisted development tool that can help with code generation, documentation, and code understanding. We need to decide how to best integrate GitHub Copilot with FTOC to maximize its benefits while maintaining code quality and consistency.

The key challenges include:
- Ensuring Copilot understands the FTOC domain and produces context-aware suggestions
- Standardizing the way developers use Copilot across different IDEs
- Extending Copilot with FTOC-specific capabilities
- Creating specialized edit modes for common FTOC tasks
- Supporting workflows in both CLI and IDE environments

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive GitHub Copilot integration strategy with the following components:

1. **IDE Configurations**
   - Configure VS Code and JetBrains IDE settings for optimal Copilot usage with FTOC
   - Create personalization settings that understand FTOC-specific patterns

2. **CLI Integration**
   - Implement GitHub Copilot CLI integrations for command-line workflows
   - Create custom aliases and scripts for common FTOC tasks

3. **VS Code Extension Prototype**
   - Develop a prototype VS Code extension that integrates with GitHub Copilot
   - Include FTOC-specific context providers to enhance suggestions
   - Build feature file parsing capabilities and tag management

4. **Copilot Edits Modes**
   - Create custom Copilot edit modes for common FTOC tasks
   - Implement templates for feature file creation, tag management, scenario outline generation
   - Support both VS Code and JetBrains IDEs with parallel configurations

5. **Code Patterns Documentation**
   - Document FTOC code patterns for better Copilot suggestions
   - Create example files to train Copilot on FTOC patterns
   - Develop prompt templates for different types of tasks

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved developer productivity through AI-assisted development
- More consistent code through standardized templates and edit modes
- Better onboarding experience for new developers
- Enhanced feature file authoring with specialized edit modes
- Support for both IDE and CLI workflows
- Documentation generation assistance

### Negative

- Additional maintenance overhead for Copilot configurations
- Need to keep Copilot integrations updated as the tool evolves
- Potential for excessive reliance on generated code
- Learning curve for developers to use Copilot effectively with FTOC

### Neutral

- Developers will need to understand when to use Copilot and when to write code manually
- Regular updates to examples and templates will be needed as the codebase evolves
- Training team members on effective Copilot usage will be required

## Implementation Plan

1. Configure basic Copilot integration for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs
2. Develop CLI integrations for command-line workflows
3. Create a VS Code extension prototype for Copilot integration
4. Implement custom edit modes for common tasks
5. Document best practices for using Copilot with FTOC

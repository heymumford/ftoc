# GitHub Copilot Extension for FTOC

This directory contains research, exploration, and development for a custom GitHub Copilot extension for the FTOC utility.

## What is a GitHub Copilot Extension?

GitHub Copilot Extensions are custom plugins for GitHub Copilot that extend its capabilities with domain-specific knowledge and functionality. These extensions can:

- Add specialized context to Copilot's responses
- Integrate with specific tools and workflows
- Enhance code generation for domain-specific tasks
- Provide customized guidance based on project requirements

## Extension Development Research

### Current Status

GitHub Copilot Extensions are in active development by GitHub. As of early 2025, the primary way to extend Copilot's functionality is through:

1. **Copilot Chat Custom Commands** - Already implemented for FTOC in:
   - `.vscode/copilot-chat/commands.json` for VS Code
   - `.idea/copilot/prompts.json` for JetBrains IDEs

2. **Copilot Chat Personalization** - Already implemented for FTOC in:
   - `.vscode/copilot-chat/personalization.json` for VS Code
   - `.idea/copilot/personalities.json` for JetBrains IDEs

3. **GitHub Copilot CLI Integration** - Already implemented for FTOC in:
   - `.github/copilot-cli/` directory with custom scripts and aliases

### Potential Extension Approaches

Based on our research, we've identified several approaches for further extending GitHub Copilot for FTOC:

#### 1. VS Code Extension with Copilot Integration

Create a VS Code extension specific to FTOC that integrates with Copilot:

- Pre-populates relevant context when editing Cucumber feature files
- Provides feature file templates with FTOC-optimized structures
- Offers real-time validation against FTOC best practices
- Integrates with Copilot to enhance feature file authoring

**Technology stack:** TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, Copilot API

#### 2. Custom Language Server Protocol (LSP) Implementation

Create a Language Server Protocol implementation for Cucumber/Gherkin that can be used by multiple IDEs and enhances Copilot with:

- FTOC-specific validation and formatting rules
- Context-aware autocompletions for tags and steps
- Integration with FTOC analysis capabilities
- Enhanced error reporting and suggestions

**Technology stack:** Java/TypeScript, LSP Framework, IDE integrations

#### 3. GitHub Copilot for CLI Enhancement

Extend our existing GitHub Copilot CLI integration with more advanced capabilities:

- Create a specialized FTOC command set building on gh-copilot
- Integrate with FTOC analysis results to provide AI-enhanced recommendations
- Generate FTOC-optimized feature files based on natural language descriptions
- Aid in interpreting and acting on FTOC analysis results

**Technology stack:** Bash, Node.js, GitHub CLI extensions

## Prototype Development

Based on feasibility assessment, we're initially focusing on the VS Code Extension approach:

### VS Code Extension for FTOC with Copilot Integration

**Features:**
- FTOC-aware syntax highlighting and validation for feature files
- FTOC tag autocompletion based on project analysis
- Integration with the Copilot API to enhance suggestions
- Quick access to FTOC analysis and reporting commands
- Visual representation of FTOC analysis results

**Implementation Path:**
1. Create basic VS Code extension for feature files
2. Add FTOC-specific validators and formatters
3. Implement Copilot integration points
4. Add visualization for FTOC analysis results
5. Package and publish to VS Code Marketplace

## Getting Started with Development

1. Install required development tools:
   ```bash
   # Prerequisites
   npm install -g yo generator-code vsce
   
   # Create extension scaffold
   yo code
   ```

2. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   cd ftoc-vscode-extension
   npm install
   ```

3. Test the extension locally:
   ```bash
   # In extension directory
   npm run compile
   # Press F5 in VS Code to launch with extension
   ```
